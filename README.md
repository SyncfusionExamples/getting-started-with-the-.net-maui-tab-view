# getting-started-with-the-.net-maui-tab-view
A quick-start project that helps you to integrate a Tab View control in a .NET MAUI application by adding the Syncfusion MAUI Tab View package from NuGet. This project contains simple code customizations, like how to add tabs items, populate the item source, and change the tab width mode, tab bar placement, and selection indicator placement.
